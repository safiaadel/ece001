     <p> <font size="5" face="arial"> Ancient Greek mythology included sentient robots and
     artificial entities for the first time. The creation of the syllogism and its application of
     deductive reasoning by Aristotle was a watershed point in humanity's
      search to comprehend its own intelligence.</font></p>

<tr> <td>2005</td> <td> The DARPA Grand Challenge is won by STANLEY, a self-driving automobile.
    The US military is beginning to invest in self-driving robots such as Boston Dynamic's "Big Dog" and iRobot's "PackBot."</td></tr>
    <tr> <td>2008</td> <td> Google makes advancements in speech recognition and incorporates it into its iPhone app.</td></tr>
    <tr> <td>2011</td> <td> On Jeopardy!, IBM's Watson outperforms the competition.</td></tr>
    <tr> <td>2012</td> <td> Andrew Ng, the Google Brain Deep Learning project's founder, feeds 10 million YouTube
         videos into a neural network using deep learning algorithms as a training set. The neural network learns to recognise
         a cat without being informed what a cat is, ushering in a new era of deep learning funding and neural networks.</td></tr>
         <tr> <td>2014</td> <td> Google's self-driving car is the first to pass a state driving test.</td></tr>
         <tr> <td>2016</td> <td> Lee Sedol, the world champion Go player, is defeated by Google
              DeepMind's AlphaGo.
              The ancient Chinese game's complexity was seen as a significant barrier to overcome in AI.</td></tr>
