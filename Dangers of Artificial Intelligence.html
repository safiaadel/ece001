        <li> <h1>  Invasion of Privacy</h1> 
            Artificial Intelligence may lead to a loss of privacy in the future. Even today, it is possible to track you easily as you go about your day.
             Latest technologies like facial recognition can find you out in a crowd and all security cameras are equipped with it.</li>
             <li> <h1> Autonomous Weapons </h1>
                Autonomous weapons or “killer robots” are military robots that can search their targets and aim independently according to pre-programmed instructions. And almost all technically advanced countries in the world are developing these robots.

            <li> <h1> Loss of Human Jobs</h1>
                it will obviously take over jobs that were once performed by humans. </li>
                <li> <h1> Artificial Intelligence Terrorism</h1> While Artificial Intelligence can contribute immensely
                     to the world, it can unfortunately also help terrorists
                      in order to perform terror attacks.</li>
                      <li> <h1> Artificial Intelligence Bias</h1>
                        It is an unfortunate fact that human beings are sometimes biased against. And this bias may unconsciously also enter into the Artificial Intelligence Systems that are developed by human beings.
